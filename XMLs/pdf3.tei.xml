(2009)</ref> did not note whether sterile-filtered wine was used or if any microbial analysis was performed to determine if change to the concentration of ρ-coutaric and ρ-coumaric acids may have been impacted by microbial activity.</s><s>This may explain some of the differences observed between the results of previous studies and the present study.</s></p><p><s>The effect of changes in ρ-coumaric acid during MLF and ageing on volatile phenol production was determined by inoculating wine with B. bruxellensis on completion of ageing.</s><s>Brettanomyces bruxellensis AWRI-1499 grew well in all wine treatments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) with a higher population being reached in lower ethanol (13%) wines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,c</ref>) in agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Oswald and Edwards (2017)</ref>.</s><s>In wines with 13% v/v ethanol, B. bruxellensis growth was similar at pH 3.60 and 3.80.</s><s>In wines containing 15% v/v ethanol, however, a lower maximum population of B. bruxellensis was observed at pH 3.60, compared to that at pH 3.80 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,d</ref>).</s><s>Again, this is in agreement with the findings of others, where B. bruxellensis grew better at a higher pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Strum et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>The only unusual result was the decrease in B. bruxellensis population after inoculation into wine (15% v/v ethanol, pH 3.60) that had undergone MLF with the CE (+) O. oeni strain.</s><s>The decrease in population was likely because of the wine unintentionally being inoculated at a lower population (7.2 × 10 4 CFU/mL) than the other wine treatments (7 × 10 5 CFU/mL).</s><s>The population of B. bruxellensis recovered in this treatment after 28 days and had achieved a similar level to that of other treatments by 42 days after inoculation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Eight weeks post-inoculation of B. bruxellensis the wines were assessed for volatile phenol concentration (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>As was seen with the concentration of ρ-coutaric and ρ-coumaric acids, the only treatment that had a significant impact on the concentration of 4-EP and 4-EG was the strain of O. oeni used to conduct MLF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Wines that underwent MLF with a CE (−) O. oeni strain contained a lower concentration of 4-EP and 4-EG than wines that underwent MLF with the CE (+) strain (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chescheir et al. (2015)</ref> also reported a significantly higher concentration of 4-EP and 4-EG after growth of B. bruxellensis in wine where MLF was conducted by a CE (+) O. oeni strain compared to wines where MLF was conducted by a CE (−) strain.</s><s>This is not surprising given the higher ρ-coumaric acid concentration in wines where MLF was conducted by a CE (+) O. oeni strain.</s><s>Wine pH or ethanol concentration did not impact the production of volatile phenols by B. bruxellensis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), even in treatments where B. bruxellensis did not initially grow as well (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Instead, the concentration of 4-EP in wines reflected the initial concentration of ρ-coumaric acid at the time of B. bruxellensis inoculation and was impacted only by the strain of O. oeni used to conduct MLF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chescheir et al. (2015)</ref>, this study demonstrates that the use of CE (+) O. oeni strains should be avoided in wines that are at risk of Brettanomyces spoilage.</s></p><p><s>While the most important factor influencing the volatile phenol concentration of wine is growth of B. bruxellensis, the action of a CE (+) O. oeni strain during MLF can increase the risk of elevated production of volatile phenols.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Madsen et al. (2017)</ref> concluded that the B. bruxellensis strain may have a larger impact on volatile phenol production than the O. oeni strain, because of the variable production of volatile phenols by B. bruxellensis strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Conterno et al. 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">, Madsen et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the growth of a low volatile phenol producing B. bruxellensis in a wine may result in a low concentration of volatile phenols no matter what the concentration of ρ-coumaric acid is.</s><s>As a result using a CE (+) or CE (−) O. oeni would be less critical.</s><s>A winemaker has no control, however, over which B. bruxellensis strain infects their wine (high-or low-volatile phenol producer).</s><s>In contrast, the winemaker has control over the O. oeni culture they inoculate to promote MLF and the use of a CE (−) O. oeni culture will minimise the amount of volatile precursors in the wine, no matter what strain of B. bruxellensis is present.</s><s>This is a relatively simple step for a winemaker given the availability of CE (−) O. oeni cultures from different manufacturers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>While winemakers must continue to use sound winemaking practices to prevent the growth of Brettanomyces in their wines, this study has shown that the strain of O. oeni used to induce MLF can have a significant impact on volatile phenol production by Brettanomyces because of an increase in the concentration of volatile phenol precursors.</s><s>While a significant change in the concentration of ρ-coutaric and ρ-coumaric acids occurred during MLF by a CE (+) O. oeni, no change due to chemical hydrolysis during ageing occurred, regardless of wine pH, ethanol concentration and storage temperature.</s><s>This finding suggests that the use of CE (+) O. oeni strains for MLF should be avoided in wines at risk of Brettanomyces spoilage.</s><s>In addition, results from the present study demonstrate an additional risk of uninoculated MLF, as the CE activity of the LAB performing MLF would be unknown.</s><s>The CE activity of other LAB that can be used to conduct MLF, such as Pediococcus and  Lactobacillus species, must also be considered, as little is known about their ability to hydrolyse ρ-coutaric acid.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Growth of Brettanomyces bruxellensis AWRI-1499 in Pinot Noir wine following MLF with (a,b) cinnamoyl esterase (CE) (−) or (c,d) CE (+) Oenococcus oeni strains, and adjustment to (a,c) 13% or (b,d) 15% ethanol (v/v) concentration, and pH 3.6 ( , ) or 3.8 ( , ).</s><s>Wine had previously been stored for 180 days, at either 13 C ( , ) or 21 C ( , ).</s><s>Error bars represent SD from the mean.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,308.30,68.37,241.31,321.17" type="bitmap" /></figure>
