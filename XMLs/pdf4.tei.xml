<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formulation of caramel model systems</head><p><s>Formulation of 3 commercially relevant caramel model systems that matched the key sensory properties of the targeted caramel categories identified in this study (Small-Scale Dark, Large-Scale Light, and Large-Scale Dark) was achieved.</s><s>Exploration of the representative samples that exemplified the characteristics of each category revealed that the content and source of sugar (white sugar, brown sugar, and/or corn syrup) and lipid (butter, margarine, corn oil, soybean oil, and/or sunflower oil) accounted for the major differences among products of each category.</s><s>Sugar and lipid sources for each representative sample are highlighted in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>All 3 commercial categories were found to contain corn syrup, and so all caramel model systems were formulated to include corn syrup as a sugar source.</s><s>Additionally, the products in the  Small-Scale Dark and Large-Scale Dark categories contain brown sugar, while the products in the Large-Scale Light group contain granulated sugar.</s><s>The use of brown sugar contributes both color and the burnt or molasses-like flavor that characterize the Smalland Large-Scale Dark products and model systems.</s><s>The type of lipid used in commercial caramel corn products was found to vary by category.</s><s>Small-Scale Dark and Large-Scale Light products both contain butter, which contributes significantly to the rich and buttery flavors identified by panelists in products from these categories.</s><s>Vegetable oils, generally more economical lipid sources, are also found in the Large-Scale products.</s><s>Accordingly, Large-Scale Light and Large-Scale Dark caramel model systems are formulated to include soybean oil and corn oil, respectively.</s><s>The final formulas for the 3 caramel model systems are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</s></p></div>

Generally, all Napping-ultra flash profile as a tool . . . of the products tested were low moisture and low a w foods, with moisture contents ranging between 1.2% and 3.8% wet basis and a w values ranging between 0.21 and 0.28.</s><s>Thermal analysis of the caramel coating systems, reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, shows that all caramel coatings studied exhibit glass transition onset temperatures at or above 20 °C.</s><s>This finding indicates that the caramel coating systems are primarily in the glassy amorphous state at room temperature.</s><s>The representative samples, Product 9, Product 1, Product 3, and Product 4, have particularly high glass transition temperatures, with T g onset values between 40 and 50 °C.</s><s>High T g values are desirable in caramel coating systems, as higher T g values can be expected to correspond to a crisper coating texture, which is preferred in caramel corn products <ref type="bibr">(Beck and others 2002)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation data</head><p><s>Sixteen analytically determined variables, 8 of which are included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, and 26 sensory terms articulated by panelists during the Napping-UFP exercise were compiled for all twelve commercial caramel corn products to generate Spearman correlation coefficients for each pair of terms and variables.</s><s>A total of 74 significant correlations were identified in this study.</s></p><p><s>Sensory descriptors that correlated significantly with analytical measures, highlighted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, are of particular interest due to our aim of validating UFP-generated sensory descriptors.</s><s>Notably, 3 analytical measures (the enthalpy of melting of the caramel coating ( H m ), moisture content, and a w ) correlated positively with stickiness, indicating that, even using a flash descriptive profiling method, panelists were able to consistently identify samples with higher moisture contents and stickier coatings.</s><s>The moisture content of the samples was also negatively correlated with the term "crispy," which shows again that panelists were able to generate relevant textural terms that related directly to the composition of the samples.</s></p><p><s>A parameter associated with the exothermic crystallization of butter on cooling (T c-butter midpoint) was positively correlated with the sensory terms "mild" and "light," which is likely due to the lighter color and milder flavor of the samples made with butter and belonging to the Large-Scale Light group.</s><s>As expected, the sensory term "crispy" correlates positively with T g onset, midpoint, and endpoint values, though these correlations were not statistically significant at a significance level of α = 0.05.</s><s>Although further descriptive sensory analysis is required to fully understand the sensory properties of caramel corn products <ref type="bibr">(Steiner and others 2003)</ref> and their relationship with key thermal, physical, and compositional properties of the samples, this study shows that a flash profiling technique, such as Napping-UFP, can be used to generate useful sensory terms which correlate to related analytical measures.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>This study represents a novel application of the Napping-UFP method as a preliminary step in the formulation of model systems.</s><s>The model systems derived in this study allow for easy experimentation and manipulation of commercially relevant caramel coating systems.</s><s>Instrumentally measured properties of the caramel model systems will be presented in a future study.</s><s>Utilization of the model systems developed can provide further insights into the effect of caramel composition on sensory and physical characteristics of the system and strengthen the bridge between sensory and physical properties of caramel coating systems.</s></p><p><s>The findings from this research has revealed some correlations between sensory descriptors and physical and thermal properties and composition of caramel coating systems, yet the meaning of the sensory terms is open to interpretation due to the informal method of term generation.</s><s>The coating systems created through this study provide an opportunity for deeper exploration into the link between composition (that is, sugar and lipid source and quantity) and dominant sensory properties of the coating system.</s><s>Descriptive analysis utilizing a trained panel could provide welldefined terminology and a more complete understanding of the sensory profile of caramel coating systems.</s><s>Additional analytical techniques, such as texture analysis, could also be implemented to probe for relationships between the sensory profile and physical characteristics of these systems.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1-Example of Napping paper sheet used by panelists.</s><s>Sample locations are marked with X's and labeled with corresponding 3-digit sample codes and descriptive terms.</s><s>Coordinates for each sample are calculated by measuring the distance from the left edge to the center of the X (x-coordinate) and from the bottom edge to the center of the X (y-coordinate).</s><s>An example calculation of xand y-coordinates for sample 485 is shown in red.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,111.48,407.99,360.00,272.52" type="bitmap" /></figure>
